Oicana is a toolset for cross-platform PDF templating using [Typst]. Write your document templates with a modern and powerfull typesetter, then create PDFs from them in your own software. Oicana comes with integrations for C# and TS/JS in the browser (more are WIP).

- *Multi-platform* - The same templates work with all Oicana integrations.
- *Powerful Layouting* - Templates can use all of Typst's functionality including its extensive package ecosystem.
- *Performant* - Create a PDF in single digit milliseconds.
- *Version Control Ready* - Templates are mostly text files and can live next to your source code.
- *Escape Vendor Lock-in* - Reuse templates with other Typst based solutions. The Typst compiler is open source!
